The Predict Next Sequence of Numbers Using LSTM project aims to forecast the next number(s) in a numerical sequence using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning to time series forecasting, with potential applications in finance, weather prediction, and other fields where understanding future values based on historical data is crucial
